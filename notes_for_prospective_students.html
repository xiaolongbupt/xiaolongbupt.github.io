I am looking for <b>self-motivated</b> PhD and Master students to work on research projects in wireless networking and ubiquitous computing. 
My research interests include Internet of Things, Wireless Networking, and Ubiquitous Computing. We have been targeting our research papers to top conferences and journals. 
Students in our team will have opportunities to work together with talented researchers all over the world, and will build a diverse skill in both system implementation and theoretical modeling.

<br><br>
Contact me if you fall into any of the following categories: 
<ol>
<li>Keen to solve challenging problems in the area of computer networks and systems.</li>
<li>Enjoy implementing your own ideas and applying them in practice.</li>
<li>Highly interested in cutting-edge information technologies that have great significance in industry and application fields.</li>
<li>Love the research lifestyle, which means independent study and thinking, paper reading/writing, discussion/seminars, programming, experiments, and travelling all over the world for academic events.</li>
</ol>

Students with a major in Computer Science or Electrical Engineering are encouraged to apply.
